# A hitchhicker's way to Go

This Go presentation aims to illustrate the main features of the Go language. 
The presentation was not written from experts, rather from novices who start to learn and 
explore those features and is a summary of the current state of our undestanding of the language.

We do not claim ownership over the external resources stored in this repo, only over the code and the written content of the presentation.
